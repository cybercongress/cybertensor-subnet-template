# What is cybertensor?

Cybertensor is a network where computers validate the work that other computers contribute to the network - the work
what is most valuable to the collective will be rewarded.

Cybertensor is a catalyst to the open-source developers and smaller AI research labs now have a financial incentive for
fine-tuning open foundational models.

Cybertensor is a library of machine intelligence that continuously grows and shares knowledge amongst peers.

# What is a subnet?

Cybertensor is releasing its own language for creating incentive mechanisms. This allows developers to build incentive
systems on cybertensor, tapping into our web of intelligence to develop markets of the developer’s choosings.

Subnet 1, an incentive system for machine intelligence production, showcases the enormous potential of markets to
procure huge amounts of resources. Releasing user-created subnets is set to create a cambrian explosion of additional
resources into the cybertensor ecosystem.

# Why should you care?

As an open-source developer, you now have the ability to write your own incentive mechanisms without creating an
entirely new chain. By tapping into cybertensor’s network of intelligence, you can incentivize AI models from all over
the world to perform tasks of your choosing (i.e., image generation, storage, compute access, etc.) - the possibilities
are truly endless.

The release of subnets also offers the potential to pull these tools into a shared network, making all the ingredients
necessary to create intelligence available within one network, governed by one token.

You get to play a vital role in helping bootstrap what could one day become one of the most powerful networks in the
world - and you make money by doing so!

By incentivizing developers to create their own markets, cybertensor is set to become a one-stop-shop for those seeking
all the compute requirements for building unstoppable applications on top of an incentivized infrastructure.
